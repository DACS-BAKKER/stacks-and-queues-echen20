Project: Stacks and Queues API and Problem Set

FILE AND PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS:

Queue: A first-in-first-out abstract data structure that adds nodes to the end of a list, and removes them from
        the beginning. This file contains the code for the Queue as well as a tester to try all the methods.

Stack: A last-in-first-out abstract data structure that adds nodes to the beginning of a list, and removes them from
        the beginning. This file contains the code for the Stack as well as a tester to try all the methods.

Josephus Problem: Given a list of people, and an increment in which people are killed, figure out who the last man
                    standing is, using an algorithm that implements a Queue.
                    This file contains my iterative and recursive solution as well as a UI to test and time both.

Djikstra Two Stack Problem: Given an equation that is complete with full sets of parentheses, solve the equation.
                            This algorithm requires the use of two stacks, one for operators and one for operands.
                            This file contains my solution as well as my attempt to alter equations W/O parentheses
                            to add parentheses in the location that will satisfy order of operations and also work with
                            my solver.

Reverse Linked List Problem: Given a linked list, find a way to reverse the linked list so the last node is the first
                                and the first node is the last. As well, only reverse pointers, without creating
                                new nodes. This file contains my iterative and recursive solutions as well as a UI to
                                test and time both.

EXTRA FILES:

Node: An object that contains a piece of data and a pointer to another node. Used for linked list data structures.

Linked List: A combination of nodes that has contains an origin node and can traverse all of the following nodes.
            This file is used primarily for the reverse linked list problem, and many of the methods were not used
            but for an in-class assignment in which you told us to code them.
